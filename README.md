## Installation and Configuration
In order to run this discord bot you have to install Nodejs. You can download it from here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ 

After the installation is complete check if "node" command works in your terminal/command promt.

Download the repository from this project https://github.com/FoxBlood72/DisRemSQL.

Configuration file is "config.json", it includes prefix(by default @) and bot token. You can generate a bot token from here: https://discord.com/developers/
Running the bot is simple, navigate to your directory where you saved the project and run "node ." command. (You have to configure it first by adding discord bot token)

## WARNINGS!
This discord bot is not the perfect one since you have to place your mysql server password in plaintext. I will try to fix this problem by adding a 3rd party website.

Currently, the bot does not support roles and permission, means that everyone that are into a guild(discord server) can execute any command they want.
## RECOMMENDATIONS
Use this bot in a private server and in a private room, do not let other people that you do not trust to join your discord server.

Give permission for the bot to manages messages for automaticaly deleting messages that you do not want.
